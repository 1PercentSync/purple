# Night Shift: Last Stop

**High Concept**
A first‑person, horror‑tinged **night delivery simulator** where **time pressure** and **misidentification risk** drive tension. After each run, corporate “safety & wellness” surveys insist **everything is normal** while workload and deadlines tighten.

**Narrative (2–3 sentences)**
A contract driver chases night‑shift bonuses through dark suburbs and unsafe city blocks. Each return to the depot yields a "reassuring" auto‑reply and a harsher route. As fatigue builds, porch lights, barking dogs, motion sensors, and watchful windows turn routine drops into fear‑filled decisions.

**Core Loop (one line)**
Plan → Drive → Park → Low‑profile approach → Place & photo → Retreat → Next stop → Depot survey → Harder route.

**Mechanics (3–4 bullets)**

* **Delivery timer**: Late lowers rating; undelivered rolls to next day.
* **Find & place**: Grab the right parcel fast; comply with app vs choose safer spot (risk complaint/loss).
* **Light & noise stealth**: Headlamp, car lights, footsteps, door slams affect detection.
* **Fatigue effects**: Narrowed vision, slower reactions.

**Unique Selling Points (3–4 bullets)**

* **Everyday‑job horror** (no monsters, no combat).
* **Corporate gaslighting** via surveys while pressure increases.
* **Time pressure × simple stealth × ethical trade‑offs** (safety vs performance).
* **Streamer‑friendly** emergent moments (homeowner checks, alarms, dogs, police verification).

**Scope / Features (one block)**
PC · First‑person · KB/M or gamepad · **3–4 levels**, **10–15 min each** (total **40–60 min**). Focus on **Art and Narrative**. Failure costs **time/ratings**, not gore.
